SnakePitGame C++ PROJECT
Game Description:

You are the player (represented by '@' symbol) who is stuck in a pit of snakes (represented by 'S' or a number signifying how many snakes are at that spot)! You must try to kill the randomly moving snakes by jumping over them when they are next to you, the player. You navigate the playing field by pressing 'u'(up), 'd'(down), 'l'(left), or 'r'(right) to move the player around. You can simplypress enter to stand in place and not move. To see how many snakes you have killed in what locations press 'h' for history.
